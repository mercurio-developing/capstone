Overview
Easy Travel is a rideshare app. It uses the service of Google Maps, Dark Sky, and Yelp. Users need to create a log-in and then can enter and either create trips or find rides to a given destination. Users can check the weather over the next few days, so that they can pick the best departure date. Yelp shows them affordable hotels they can stay at upon arrival. In order to ensure drivers and riders are dependable people users can review eachother at the end of the trip.
